# Fayette County Geographic Data Layers
Sample of creating selectors and simple visualizations using FCPS data model for geographic data layers.

# TODO
- [ ] Add zoom functionality
- [ ] Add tooltips to display geometry attributes
- [ ] Add mouseover to provide visual feedback to end users showing appropriate path element

## Additional Information
All of the data on display are currently - or planned - to be available from [Fayette County's Open Data Portal](http://data.lexingtonky.gov/).  The only data available are geographic boundaries and their associated attributes (e.g., names of the associated elected officials in the case of political boundaries, names of schools for school attendance zones, etc...).
